# olist_store-analysis
Brief
Olist Store is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. The Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders (from 2016 to 2018) made at Olist Store is provided to your company for analysis.

Your manager is asking you to critically analyse the provided datasets using Business Intelligence tools and provide some marketing findings / recommendations in a report format. The dataset has information of 100k orders made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. A geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates is also integrated in the dataset.

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store, a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where they can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
